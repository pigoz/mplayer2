/*
 * Implementation details:
 * This file deals with custom event polling on MacOSX. When mplayer2 is paused
 * it will asynchronously poll for events using select. This works correctly on
 * Linux with X11 since the events are notified through the file descriptors
 * where mplayer2 is listening on. On the other hand, the OSX window server
 * notifies the processes for events using mach ports.
 *
 * The code below uses functionality from Cocoa that abstracts the async polling
 * of events from the window server. When a Cocoa event comes in, the polling is
 * interrupted and the event is dealt with in the next vo_check_events.
 *
 * To keep the select fd polling code working, that functionality is executed
 * from another thread. Whoever finishes polling before the given time, be it
 * Cocoa or the original select code, notifies the other for an immediate wake.
