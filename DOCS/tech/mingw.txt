Cross compiling from Linux to Windows/mingw32
=============================================

First install a mingw environment on your system.
One way is using the mingw-cross-env script from http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/

Make sure the cross compiler toolchain (e.g. i686-pc-mingw32-gcc) is in your $PATH.

Then run this in the mplayer source directory:

./configure --enable-cross-compile --target=i686-mingw32 --with-pkg-config=i686-pc-mingw32-pkg-config --cc=i686-pc-mingw32-gcc --windres=i686-pc-mingw32-windres --ranlib=i686-pc-mingw32-ranlib --with-freetype-config=/path/to/mingw/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/bin/freetype-config --disable-unrarexec

"make" should then produce a mplayer.exe.

Note that --target does not specify a cross compilation prefix. The configure
script will attempt to parse it, and can fail silently if it contains unexpected
strings. As of this writing, there is no way to specify a cross compilation
prefix.

Specifying the full path to freetype-config is needed to avoid using the host's
freetype installation, as it's not prefixed.

libass and ffmpeg are included in mingw-cross-env and should be no problem. The
cross pkg-config should find them if they are installed.
